###How To Use These Files

1. Clone this repository
2. Find an executable file and place it in /installers (I used notepad++ installer that I had lying around in my Downloads folder)
3. Replace all instances of "[yourInstallerHere]" with the name of the installer file. You can find them in these files:
  ⋅⋅⋅runInstaller.sh
  ⋅⋅⋅/common/commonAnywhereScript.sh
  ⋅⋅⋅/common/commonScript.sh
